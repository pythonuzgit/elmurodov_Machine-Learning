#  Machine learning with Python

Within the field of machine learning, there are two main types of tasks: supervised and unsupervised. Scikit-learn provides a wide selection of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. 

Scikit-Learn is built on top several common data and math python libraries.

NumPy: a library for scientific computing, Linear Algebra and array package.

Pandas: it provides DataFrame class. Data structures and analysis.

Matplotlib: Data visualization, allows to create various 2d and 3d groups.

SciPy: Fundamental library for scientific computing.

SymPy: Symbolic mathematics.

Supervised Learning algorithm

Supervised learning algorithms can be used to solve both and classification and regression problems.

Linear Regresion:

Logistic regression:

k-nearest neigbors:

Support vector machines (SVM):

Naive Bayes:

Unsupervised learning algorithm will be use a metric such as distance in order to identify how close a set of points are to each other and how far apart two such groups are.

k-Means cluster:
