#  Machine learning with Python

Within the field of machine learning, there are two main types of tasks: supervised and unsupervised. Scikit-learn provides a wide selection of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. 

Scikit-Learn is built on top several common data and math python libraries.

NumPy: a library for scientific computing, Linear Algebra and array package.

Pandas: it provides DataFrame class. Data structures and analysis.

Matplotlib: Data visualization, allows to create various 2d and 3d groups.

SciPy: Fundamental library for scientific computing.

SymPy: Symbolic mathematics.

# Supervised Learning algorithm

 Supervised learning algorithms can be used to solve both and classification and regression problems.

Linear Regresion: This Supervised Learning algorithm is used to predict continuous, numerical values based on given data input. Linear Regression tries to find parameters of the linear function, so the distance between the all the points and the like is as small as possible.

Logistic regression: as a tool for building model which is used to a descrete set of classes. Logistic regression is commonly used when the response variable is continuous and a more complex cost function, this cost function can be defined as the 'Sigmoid function'.

k-nearest neigbors: k-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN) is a non-parmetric method and can be used for both classification and regression problem.

Support vector machines (SVM): SVMs are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Support vector machines can be defined as systems which use hypothesis space of a linear functions in a high dimensional feature space, trained with a learning algorithm from optimization theory that implements a learning bias derived from statistical learning theory.

Naive Bayes: It is a classification technique based on Bayes' theorem and very easy to build and partucularity useful for very large data sets.

# Unsupervised learning 
algorithm will be use a metric such as distance in order to identify how close a set of points are to each other and how far apart two such groups are.
