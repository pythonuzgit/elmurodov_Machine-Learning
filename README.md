#  Machine learning with Python

Within the field of machine learning, there are two main types of tasks: supervised and unsupervised. Scikit-learn provides a wide selection of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. 

Scikit-Learn is built on top several common data and math python libraries.

NumPy: a library for scientific computing, Linear Algebra and array package.

Pandas: it provides DataFrame class. Data structures and analysis.

Matplotlib: Data visualization, allows to create various 2d and 3d groups.

SciPy: Fundamental library for scientific computing.

SymPy: Symbolic mathematics.

# Supervised Learning algorithm

 Supervised learning algorithms can be used to solve both and classification and regression problems.

Linear Regresion: 
This Supervised Learning algorithm is used to predict continuous, numerical values based on given data input. Linear Regression tries to find parameters of the linear function, so the distance between the all the points and the like is as small as possible.

Logistic regression: 
as a tool for building model which is used to a descrete set of classes. Logistic regression is commonly used when the response variable is continuous and a more complex cost function, this cost function can be defined as the 'Sigmoid function'.

k-nearest neigbors: 
k-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN) is a non-parmetric method and can be used for both classification and regression problem.

Support vector machines (SVM): 
SVMs are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Support vector machines can be defined as systems which use hypothesis space of a linear functions in a high dimensional feature space, trained with a learning algorithm from optimization theory that implements a learning bias derived from statistical learning theory.

Naive Bayes: 
algorithm can be defined as a supervised classification algorithm which is based on Bayes' theorem.

Artificial Neural Network: 
Neurons are interconnected nerve sells in the brain that are involved in the processing and transmitting of chemical and electrical signals.

# Unsupervised learning 
algorithm will be use a metric such as distance in order to identify how close a set of points are to each other and how far apart two such groups are.

k-Means cluster: We can use many algorithms to obtain some good results. To solve this kind of a specific problem in the best way. Therefore, the specific algorithm that you want to might depend on the problem you are trying to solve and also on what algorithm are available in the specific package that you are using. For this example, I use method of K-means cluster. As we know some of the first clustering algorithm consisted of simply finding the centroid positions that minimize the distances to all the points in each cluster. The points in each cluster are closer to that centroid than other cluster centroids. As might be obvious at this point, the hardest part with this is figuring out how many clusters there are.
