#  Machine learning with Python

Within the field of machine learning, there are two main types of tasks: supervised and unsupervised. Scikit-learn provides a wide selection of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. 

Scikit-Learn is built on top several common data and math python libraries.

NumPy: a library for scientific computing, Linear Algebra and array package
Pandas: it provides DataFrame class. Data structures and analysis
Matplotlib: Data visualization, allows to create various 2d and 3d groups.
SymPy: Symbolic mathematics
SciPy: Fundamental library for scientific computing
